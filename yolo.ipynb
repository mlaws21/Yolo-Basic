    "Developed in 2015 by Redmon et. al., YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a deep learning architecture which greatly improved the efficiency of image detection networks. The goal is simply: to detect objects appearing in an image, with their corresponding bounding boxes (see above image). Previous networks would train separately for category detection (dog, bicyle, laptop, e.g.) and bounding box detection (where an object appears in an image), going back and forth between the two to refine predictions. Redmon et. al. proposed a novel method in which bounding boxes and categories were predicted together in one pass through a single model, hence the model's name *You Only Look Once.*\n",
